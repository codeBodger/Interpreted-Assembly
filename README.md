# Interpreted-Assembly
* To use this, you'll need to be able to interact with the Raspberry Pi Sense Hat.  
* You may need to modify some things in order to be able to use it properly, as the libraries are not
  (to my knowledge) publicly available.  

## Usage
* Compile `interpreter.c`
* Run `compiler.py` with the file that you want to compile as an argument
* Run the compiled `interpreter.c` with your compiled file (`b.piout`) as an argument
